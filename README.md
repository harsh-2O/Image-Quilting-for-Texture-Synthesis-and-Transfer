Image quilting is a technique used in computer graphics and image processing for creating large, seamless textures from a smaller sample. 

Here's a breakdown of its key steps:

Sample Texture:

Definition: This is a small piece of image or texture that serves as the basis for the larger image you want to create. The quality and characteristics of this sample texture largely determine the final outcome of the quilting process.

Patch Selection:

Definition: In this step, small patches (sub-images) are selected from the sample texture. These patches are usually square or rectangular.

Minimum Boundary Cut:

Definition: This is a critical step in making the quilting process seamless. When patches are placed next to each other, there are usually noticeable seams. To minimize these, the algorithm finds the path of minimum error (or least noticeable seam) along the boundary where two patches overlap.
